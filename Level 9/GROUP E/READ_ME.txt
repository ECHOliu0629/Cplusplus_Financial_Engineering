I modified the code provided and stored some of the final excel graphs in excel files. I added the option class from part A to this project, overriding the price functions to return a Vector that isn't from STL.

excel files below:
"testMultiCurve_results_in_Excel_4_calls.xlsx"
this has call prices from batch1-batch4 with S = 50  to S = 100 in increments of one.

"testSingleCurve_results_in_Excel.xlsx"
this uses batch 1 data to calculate call price for S = 55 to S = 75.

"testTwoCurve_results_in_Excel.xlsx"
this uses batch data to plot call and put prices from S = 55 to S = 75
