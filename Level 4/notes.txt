2.4.1:
operator==: The if is redundant; simply return the boolean expression itself
operator *=: No need for a temp object here; should scale m_x and m_y directly
2.4.4: operator<< should demonstrate the benefit of making it a friend -- that it can now access the private members of Point
2.5.3:
All the accessors should validate the upper and lower bounds of index
Should not be subtracting 1 from index. Proper bounds for Array is 0 to size-1
